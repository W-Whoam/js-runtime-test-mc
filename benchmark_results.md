## 🚀 Throughput Scaling

### Scaling Efficiency (vs. 1 Worker Baseline)

| Workers | Deno Total (×1) | Bun Total (×1) | Deno Efficiency | Bun Efficiency | Winner |
| ------- | --------------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| 1       | 1×              | 1×             | 100%            | 100%           | —      |
| 4       | 3.09×           | 3.69×          | 77%             | 92%            | 🟡 Bun |
| 32      | 11.66×          | 12.49×         | 36%             | 39%            | 🟡 Bun |
| 128     | 11.77×          | 18.09×         | 9%              | 14%            | 🟡 Bun |

> **Interpretation:**
>
> - Ideal linear scaling (N workers → N× throughput) would yield 4×, 32×, and
>   128× increases.
> - Both runtimes show diminishing returns after 32 workers due to CPU and
>   context-switch overhead.
> - **Bun maintains higher scaling efficiency** across all concurrency levels,
>   showing superior parallelism handling.

### Total Throughput Trend

Workers: 1 4 32 128 Deno (pps): 5.6K 17.3K 65.3K 65.9K Bun (pps): 6.0K 22.0K
74.6K 108.1K

**Bun’s throughput continues scaling up to 128 workers**, while **Deno plateaus
beyond 32**, indicating a stronger event-loop and concurrency model in Bun’s TCP
layer.

## ⏱️ Latency Scaling

| Concurrency | Deno Max Latency | Bun Max Latency | Ratio | Winner |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 Worker    | ~3.2 ms          | ~2.9 ms         | 1.1×  | 🟡 Bun |
| 4 Workers   | ~6.4 ms          | ~4.3 ms         | 1.5×  | 🟡 Bun |
| 32 Workers  | 28.55 ms         | 10.24 ms        | 2.8×  | 🟡 Bun |
| 128 Workers | 122.31 ms        | 13.53 ms        | 9.0×  | 🟡 Bun |

> **Bun’s latency scaling is exponential advantage**: as concurrency increases,
> Deno’s max latency spikes dramatically while Bun remains stable.\
> This makes Bun far more suitable for real-time TCP systems (e.g., game
> servers, chat backends, or multiplayer proxies).

## ⚙️ Runtime Efficiency Trends

| Metric                   | Deno                       | Bun                         | Winner |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------ |
| CPU Scaling              | Saturates after 32 workers | Efficient up to 128 workers | 🟡 Bun |
| Event Loop Delay         | Increases linearly         | Nearly constant             | 🟡 Bun |
| Memory Usage (estimated) | Higher under 128 workers   | More compact allocations    | 🟡 Bun |
| Latency Stability        | Unstable at 32–128 workers | Consistent and low          | 🟡 Bun |

**Conclusion:**\
Bun’s TCP stack appears to use more efficient epoll/kqueue integration, yielding
better concurrency and predictability.\
Deno’s single-threaded core and structured async overhead limit its throughput
and increase jitter at scale.

**Test Environment:**

- Local loopback (127.0.0.1), 5000 packets per worker
- Packet: Varint-prefixed + random payload
- Metrics: average pps, throughput scaling, max latency, scaling efficiency

**Verdict:**\
While **Deno** performs admirably up to moderate concurrency, **Bun’s TCP
implementation delivers higher throughput and drastically superior latency
consistency** as worker count increases.\
For performance-critical networking workloads — especially **Minecraft servers,
proxies, or realtime systems** — **Bun is the clear choice**.
