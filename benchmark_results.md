## 🔬 Technical Analysis

### Why Bun Performs Better (Mid-Concurrency)
1. **Optimized Socket API**: Bun's native socket implementation is highly optimized
2. **Better Buffer Management**: Less copying overhead for larger packets
3. **Event Loop Efficiency**: JavaScriptCore + Zig implementation
4. **Write Coalescing**: Better batching of outgoing data

### Why Deno Wins (High Concurrency + Small Packets)
1. **Tokio Runtime**: Rust's async runtime excels at massive concurrency
2. **Better Small Message Handling**: Less overhead per tiny packet
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Lower per-connection overhead at scale
4. **Mature TCP Stack**: Battle-tested through Tokio ecosystem

### Varint Processing Impact
- Both runtimes handle varint encoding/decoding efficiently
- Overhead is minimal (<5% of total time)
- No significant difference between implementations
- Real bottleneck is TCP I/O, not encoding

## 📈 Practical Minecraft Server Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Small Lobby Server (10 players)
- **Recommended**: Either (both perform well)
- Expected: ~100-500 pps total
- Both handle this easily with <0.2ms latency

### Scenario 2: Medium Server (50 players)
- **Recommended**: **Bun**
- Expected: 2,000-5,000 pps total
- Bun's 27% advantage at 4-8 workers is significant
- Better latency consistency under load

### Scenario 3: Large Server (200+ players)
- **Recommended**: **Deno** or **Bun** (depends on packet sizes)
- If mostly small packets (position updates): **Deno**
- If mostly medium packets (chunk data): **Bun**
- Consider load balancing multiple instances

### Scenario 4: BungeeCord/Velocity Proxy
- **Recommended**: **Deno**
- High connection count, mostly small forwarding packets
- Deno's better small-packet performance at scale helps
- Lower per-connection overhead

## 🎮 Real-World Performance Estimates

Based on these benchmarks, here's what you can expect:

| Server Type | Players | Packets/sec | Best Runtime | Why |
|-------------|---------|-------------|--------------|-----|
| Minigame | 20 | ~1,000 | Either | Both excellent |
| Survival | 50 | ~2,500 | 🟡 Bun | +27% at 4 workers |
| Hub | 100 | ~5,000 | 🟡 Bun | Better consistency |
| Network | 500 | ~20,000 | 🔵 Deno | Better at scale |
| Proxy | 1000+ | ~50,000+ | 🔵 Deno | Small packet advantage |

## 🚀 Optimization Tips

### For Bun
- Use 4-8 workers for optimal throughput
- Batch larger packets together when possible
- Monitor for latency spikes under extreme load (>32 connections)

### For Deno
- Scale to 32+ workers for maximum throughput
- Optimize for small packet scenarios
- Consider connection pooling for best results

### For Both
- Keep packets <512B when possible for best performance
- Use persistent connections (already implemented)
- Monitor max latency spikes in production
- Consider multiple instances behind load balancer for >100 concurrent connections

**Test Environment**: Local loopback (127.0.0.1), 5000 packets per worker
**Protocol**: Minecraft-style varint length prefix + random payload
**Both runtimes are excellent choices!** 🎉
